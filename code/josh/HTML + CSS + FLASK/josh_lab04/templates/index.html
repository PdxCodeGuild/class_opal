<!-- Lab 4: Blog
Let's make the template of a blog with a title, top-nav, side-nav, and multiple posts. Use flexbox and semantic elements (header, nav, section, and footer).
You can use a custom font, fancy colors, and make generate fake content using an Ipsum.
Make sure you have a responsive design that offers different, legible layouts for phone, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
You can test this in the browser devtools. Don't forget to use cascading min-width media queries for a mobile first design,
and remember to include the responsive meta tag in your HTML.
It should look professional, but this does not mean it needs to be complicated. A clean, simple, minimalist layout with custom color palette, fonts,
and subtle backgrounds or whitespace works great. For examples of simple yet attractive design, check out:

Step 3
Create the Flask template for your blog and make sure that in your Python code you pass your blog posts into your template. Use the Flask template to 
render the blog posts in your Python into a full webpage and make sure you add the other items required -- header, footer, top and/or side navigation.
HINT: You'll want to loop though each dictionary in your posts, and then render each value in the dictionary in its proper place in your template.

Step 4
Create a static folder and a CSS file for your Flask website and make sure you link to it in your template.
From there, create a responsive, mobile-first design for your blog with at least three screen sizes. -->
