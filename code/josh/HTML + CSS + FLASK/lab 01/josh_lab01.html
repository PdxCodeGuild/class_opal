            <p class="text">Adam was born Prince of Eternia.  He is the son of King Randor and Queen Marlena (an Earthling).<br>
                His twin sister, Adora, was kidnapped at birth and raised by Hordak (leader of the Evil Horde) on Etheria.<br>
                Although a rather lackadaisical individual, Adam's life and the life of his aptly-named friend Cringer (a green tiger),<br> 
                changed drastically the day he received the Sword of Power from Teela Na, Sorceress of Castle Grayskull.<br>
                With this Sword, and by the mystical power of Castle Grayskull, Prince Adam is changed into ...<br>
                <em><strong>He-Man</em></strong>, the most powerful man in the universe.<br>
                His friend Cringer is also changed into the mighty Battle Cat. And thus, their adventures begin.</p>
