            <h1>The Secret Identity of Prince Adam</h1>
            <p>Adam was born Prince of Eternia.  He is the son of King Randor and Queen Marlena (an Earthling).</p>
            <p>His twin sister, Adora, was kidnapped at birth and raised by Hordak (leader of the Evil Horde) on Etheria.</p>
            <p>Although a rather lackadaisical individual, Adam's life and the life of his aptly-named friend Cringer (a green tiger),</p> 
            <p>changed drastically the day he received the Sword of Power from Teela Na, Sorceress of Castle Grayskull.</p>
            <p>With this Sword, and by the mystical power of Castle Grayskull, Prince Adam is changed into He-Man, the most powerful man in the universe.</p>
            <p>His friend Cringer is also changed into the mighty Battle Cat. And thus, their adventures begin.</p>
