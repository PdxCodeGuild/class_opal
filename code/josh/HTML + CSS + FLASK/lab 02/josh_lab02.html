Use media queries and CSS flexbox and/or grid to create a responsive design that offers different, legible layouts for phone, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. 
You can test this in the browser devtools. Don't forget to use cascading min-width media queries for a mobile first design, and remember 
to include the responsive meta tag in your HTML. Browse the internet for existing company pages and imitate as much as you can.

Suggested Steps:
1. Create the HTML structure for your landing page, with all content included.
2. Create your mobile version, using the styling of your choice.
3. Use min-width media queries to add a tablet layout using flexbox. Customize your styling as needed. 
You probably want your breakpoint between phone and tablet widths to be somewhere around 640-768px.
4. Finally, add your desktop layout. Customize styling as needed. A good breakpoint for desktop screen sizes is around 960-1100px. -->
