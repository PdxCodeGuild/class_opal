# Lab 14: Automated Tests

# Write automated tests that run with pytest for the following labs:
# Peaks and Valleys
# ARI
# ATM

# Each function should have it's own set of tests and each set of tests should have multiple assertions. Test all of the edge cases you can think of, 
# but keep individual assertions small. For example, for peaks and valleys you might test [1, 2, 3, 2] and [3, 2, 3, 2] instead of long lists.

# If you need to refactor your code to make it more testable, include the refactored code in your pull request.
