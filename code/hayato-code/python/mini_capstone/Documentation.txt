Summary:
As a DJ, one of the essential tools to have when transitioning
to a new song are to determine the BPM (Beats per minute). Too fast 
or too slow of a piece (in terms of BPM) during a transition 
could ultimately ruin the whole atmosphere and vibe of the session.
One of the easiest ways to ensure that you make a successful 
transition is knowing the BPM and maintaining that 
BPM within a margin of +/- 3-5 beats per minute.
Though besides knowing the BPM, there are other factors that 
you will need to consider when deciding on the next song. 
Knowing the BPM could assist you when decisions need to be 
made quickly. 


Here is a little python tool that will run a song, 
download the Mp4 format, convert it to an Mp3 format, 
and provide the beats per minute.
