        <p class="intro">Salem is a little American Shorthair cat. He was born in a barn in Idaho, where he was found by a curious pair of cousins who whisked him away to his new home in Virginia. Salem prides himself on his mousing and baby bunny torturing abilities, and if one is lucky enough to garner his love and attention, they will be proudly presented with a loving gift: a freshly captured rodent. Salem is very vocal and will gladly carry on a conversation with anyone willing to speak cat, or even unwilling if food is involved.</p>

        <h2> Salem The Intrepid Explorer</h2> 
        <p>Having criss-crossed the country numerous times, Salem has lived in states on both sides of the country, including the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oregon</li>
            <li>Idaho</li>
            <li>Virginia</li>
        </ul>

        <q>I never met a small animal I didn't want to torture.</q>
