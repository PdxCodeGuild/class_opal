# Pokémon Face-off

Pokémon, or Pocket Monsters, is a popular game where trainers often face off in battles to determine whose Pokémon is the strongest. One of the main features of the game are Pokémon types, such as Water or Fire, which will factor into whether a Pokémon will be stronger or weaker against its opponent.

For example, a Fire type Pokémon will be weak against a Water-based opponent, and two Grass-type Pokémon will deal weaker-than-usual damage to each other, as they're both resistant to Grass. This is not always the case, and it can get more complicated when factoring in dual-typed Pokémon.

## How it Works

This program uses user input and [Pokéapi](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#info) to determine which trainer's Pokémon will win in a battle based on whose type is strongest against the other and base stats pulled for each Pokémon.
