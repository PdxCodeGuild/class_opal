    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>A wandering samurai from Inazuma who is currently with Liyue's Crux Fleet. A gentle and carefree soul whose heart hides a great many burdens from the past.</p>
    <p>This young man's calm personality belies a razor sharp blade that has seen many battles. Who knows if it was the storms of life that smoothed out his rough edges, or if his natural restraint has kept his edge sheathed... <br \>

    <h2>Kazuha's Musings:</h2>
    <div id="poetry">
        <p>Solitary cloud,<br \>
            Shadow in the setting sun<br \>
            Stirs the drifter's heart
        </p>
        <p>On this mountain path, where the red leaves lifeless lie... My heart calls for a companion, echoing the deer's cry...</p>
        <p>Sun and moon rejoice<br \>
            Birds of dawn sing songs anew<br \>
            Far from home, with you</p>
        <p>I gaze up at the moon and lend my ear to the gentle breeze, with wine in my cup and peace in my heart… Have a wonderful evening.</p>
